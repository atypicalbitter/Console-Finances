## Description

Within this challenge, I was given a  real-world situation where I was tasked with creating code for analyzing the financial records of a company.

## Introduction

My goal was to calculate what is stated below - 

* The total number of months included in the dataset.

* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* You will need to track what the total change in Profit/Losses are from month to month and then find the average.

* The greatest increase in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

* The greatest decrease in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

This code essentially goes through each month in the financial dataset, I have instructed it to perform calculations such as net total, average change, and identifies the months with the greatest increase and decrease in profit/loss. 


## About

I started by pseudo coding out what I needed to do for this challenge within my JS file. This way when I was working through the task, I could recite back if I was getting lost at all. 

I started by naming and establishing the variables which I had as 

* var finances - this data was already provided which was a dataset composed of arrays with two fields, Date and Profit/Losses
* var totalMonths -  set to the total number of months in the finances dataset. It is determined by the length of the finances array.
* var netTotal - will store the total profit/loss over the entire period.
* var totalChange - will store the sum of changes in profit/loss over the entire period.
* var greatestIncrease & var greatestDecrease - These are objects used to store information about the greatest increase and decrease in profit/loss. 

I then used a for loop to loop through the dataset and then used the 'date' and 'profitLoss' to house the date and profit/loss for the month. After this I went on to calculate the net total by adding the profit/loss for the month. 

The next step was to calculate the chnage and greatest increase/decrese which I went about by using an if statement. Then calculated the average chnage by using the formula (Total Change) / (Number of months - 1).

At the end I displayed everything with Console.log for each statement. 

I got the console to display the numbers with pounds sterling and decimnal points by using - 
* console.log('The Net total is Â£' + netTotal.toLocaleString('en-GB'));

I used "toLocaleString('en-GB')" to format the numbers accordingly. 

This is what was shown in the console at the end -
